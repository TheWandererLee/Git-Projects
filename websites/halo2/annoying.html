Tell the employee this. Order with your door open, pay with your door open. Roll down window and take food through the window.<br>Stand close to the speaker and yell your order, using colorful expletives in ways which would embarrass the patrons inside.<br>After ordering, cover the speaker and mic with transparent tape. Watch as customers and order-takers are unable to hear each other and, thus, each raises his/her volume.<br>Speak a foreign language (make one up if you have to). When the manager comes to the mic, speak English and inquire as to why the order taker had such difficulty understanding you.<br>Attempt to take the order-takers order ("Hi, may I take your order?") before they get a chance to take yours.<br>Order confusing items, i.e., "Hi, I'll have a large orange Coke and a small medium fries, please."<br>In a crowded drive-thru line, place a HUGE order, then slip out of line and watch the fun as the person behind you is handed 40 bags of food.<br>When you arrive at the window to pick up your food, hand them several bags of garbage and ask if they'll dispose of it for you. Make sure it smells.<br>Drive through with a car load of naked people.<br>Speak in such a garbled fashion that the order-taker will think there is a problem with the speaker and ask you to order at the window. When you arrive at the window, speak in the same garbled, incomprehensible fashion.<br>Drive through with someone on the hood to accept the food.<br>Bring along a Mr. Microphone. When the order-taker speaks, aim the mic at their speaker but do so while aiming the Mr. Microphone speaker at the mic to produce excruciating feedback of their own voice.<br>Have a friend hide in the trunk. When you approach the window to pickup your order, have him start yelling and banging his fists on the trunk.<br>If you are a male, have a female friend place the order by speaking VERY seductively and suggestively into the speaker. When she finishes, have her hide and pull up to accept your order. See how many of the order-takers fellow employees have been called over to the window to "check out the babe."<br>All of the above work very well when done at the late night pick up window.

<a name=11-><h2>How to annoy other drivers</h2></a>
After you cut off a vehicle, give a "Thanks-for-letting-me-in" wave and nod to the other driver. <br>Always save your nose picking for when you're behind the wheel. <br>Drive closely behind speeding ambulances and fire trucks so you get ahead of everyone who pulls over to let them pass. <br>Drive with a pen and ATM envelope in your hand and write down everything a moron driver does. <br>If another driver honks at you, ignore it, continue to do exactly what you are doing, and give him a dirty look. <br>If another driver is courteous enough to let you in front of him/her, show your appreciation by letting the entire world in front of you, including tractor trailers and construction vehicles. <br>If for some reason you had to pull over on the shoulder, wait until a car is approaching to pull back onto the road. <br>If the driver behind you is honking and flashing his headlights because he is in some sort of an emergency rush, do NOT pull over to let him pass. <br>If you are driving fast, stick one arm out the window, twist your hand back and forth, and pretend to be an airplane as the wind lifts your arm. <br>If you are on vacation and you see any sort of wildlife, stop in your lane to take a lot of pictures. <br>If you get lost while driving, the best place to stop and get your bearings is at a green light. <br>If you have a car phone, use it as much as possible. If you have no one to call, hold the phone up to your ear and pretend. <br>If you need to stop to ask for directions, wait until there is a car behind you and stop in your lane to block traffic. Try to ask directions from either a 90 year old local, a deaf person, an illegal alien, or a child. <br>If you see a vehicle getting in your lane directly behind you, hit your brake pedal. The closer the vehicle, the harder you should press. <br>If you see an emergency vehicle traveling on the opposite side of a concrete divider, stop abruptly. <br>If your vehicle is capable of spinning its tires on dry roads, take advantage of this. Make as much black smoke as possible. <br>Keep your brake light blinking by keeping one foot on the brake pedal at all times. <br>Maintain flex-time at work so that you can drive around leisurely when others are rushing to get to work on time. <br>Make sure you have at least one of the following bumper stickers: <br>"I may be slow but I'm ahead of you" <br>"If you don't like my driving, get off the sidewalk" <br>"If you can read this, you're too close" <br>"I'd rather be skiing" <br>"I brake for no apparent reason" <br>On multi-laned roads, always drive at the same speed as the vehicle next to you. Try to "box" in drivers behind you, who are attempting to pass. <br>Slow down drastically for every little bump in the road. <br>Swerve into the opposite lanes to avoid hitting roadside obstacles... like Styrofoam cups and Twinkie wrappers. <br>Use your driving time as an opportunity to have an intimate encounter with your significant other. <br>When approaching a curve in the road, slow down as if the road is ENDING. <br>When approaching a yield sign, either accelerate without looking or come to a full and complete stop. <br>When drivers ahead of you pull over to let emergency vehicles pass, accelerate so that they can not merge back into traffic. <br>When driving at a slower speed, stay in the left-most lane. <br>When driving in a lane that is going to end because of construction, ignore all the "LANE CLOSED - MERGE AHEAD" signs. Then wait until the last second and cut off the other drivers that had the common sense to switch lanes earlier. <br>When driving in heavy bumper-to-bumper traffic, always drive with at least 10 car lengths in front of you. <br>When having another vehicle follow you to where ever you are going, and a third car merges between you, drive 5 miles an hour just to make sure that your followers (who are 2 cars behind) can see you. <br>When picking up a passenger during the early morning or late night, in a residential neighborhood, stop in front of the house and honk the horn. Either a series of long honks or in a melody of a song such as "Shave and a haircut" is appropriate. <br>When there's traffic behind you, always drive 8-20 MPH below the posted limit. <br>Whenever possible, cut off other drivers and slow down. <br>Whenever you see a police car, even parked, slam on the brakes and drive 15-20 MPH slower than the speed limit. <br>While listening to your favorite song, let other drivers on the road know that your listing to your favorite song. The best way to do this is, is to steer the car with your knee, pretend to be holding a pair of drum sticks, and start beating away at the steering wheel and rear-view mirror. While the whole time bobbing your head all over the place. <br>While traveling down residential streets, drive 2 MPH and look at all the houses and landscaping. In fact, look everywhere except out the front windshield. <br>Women are encouraged to put on their make-up while driving. <br>You always have the right of way. <br>Your car stereo should be blasting music at approximately 900,000 dB.

Always put staples in the right hand corner. Go ahead and put a down the whole right side. The extractors who remove the mail from the envelopes have to take out any staples in the right side. <br>Never arrange paperwork in the right order, or even facing the right way. Put a few upside down and backwards. That way they have to remove all your staples rearrange your paperwork and re-staple it (on the left side). <br>Line the bottom of your envelope with elmer's glue and let it dry before you put in your forms, so that the automated opener doesn't open it and the extractor has to open it by hand. <br>If your very unfortunate and have to pay taxes use a two or three party check. <br>On top of paying with a three party check pay one of the dollars you owe in cash. When an extractor receives cash, no matter how small an amount, he has to take it to a special desk and fill out of few nasty forms. <br>Write a little letter of appreciation. Any letter received has to read and stamped regardless of what it is or what its on. Write your letter on something misshapen and unconventional. Like on <br>the back of a Kroger sack. <br>When you mail it, mail it in a big envelope (even if its just a single EZi form). Big envelopes have to be torn and sorted differently than regular business size ones. An added bonus to the big envelope is that they take priority over other mail, so the workers can hurry up and deal with your mess. <br>If you send 2 checks they'll have to staple your unsightly envelope to your half destroyed form. <br>Always put extra paper clips on your forms. Any foreign fasteners or the like have to be removed and put away. <br>Sign your name in ink on every page. Any signature has to verified and then date stamped.

<a name=29-><h2>Ways to annoy your professors</h2></a>
Bring a small cactus to class with you. Raise your hand, and when you're called on, say that the cactus has a question. Turn and look at the cactus, as if you're waiting for it to say something. After a few moments, shrug, and wait for your professor to move on. Do this once a day, and become increasingly irritated with the cactus every time, sighing heavily and giving it evil looks when it fails to "speak." When you leave the room after class, start yelling at the cactus, "I can't believe you embarrassed me AGAIN...." <br>Bring a vacuum to class. Halfway through class, stand up and start using it. If your professor objects, explain that you "can't stand sitting in this pigsty any longer." Keep vacuuming, grumbling angrily. <br>Brush your teeth during class. While doing so, raise your hand as if you have a question, and mumble your question incoherently while brushing, spewing toothpaste all over the place. If your professor objects to your actions, go on a tirade about proper oral hygiene. <br>Carve a bust of your professor out of cheese. Tie a ribbon around it, and present it to him/her at the beginning of class. Demand extra credit. <br>Come to class every day wearing scary Halloween masks. Try to get your professor to guess who you are. Shoot him/her with a water pistol, scream, and run around the room knocking things over. Say, "Pretty scary, huh?" <br>Come to class with a jar full of angry hornets. Five minutes into class, release the hornets, scream, and run away. <br>Dispute everything your professor says, no matter how simple. Try to get him/her to "prove" everything to you. Rant and rave about what a big liar your professor is. Yell at students who are taking notes, saying, "Stop writing down all these lies!" <br>Draw hearts and flowers on the backs of your papers and tests. Next to them, write things like, "You're the best, even though you suck" and "You're the worst professor in the world, but I still love you." <br>Every time your professor stutters, do a shot. If he/she objects, explain that drinking games make the class more interesting. <br>Get a monkey, and bring it to class with you. Tell your professor that you've hired the monkey to take notes for you. Sit back and relax during class, letting the monkey scribble on a piece of paper.

Insist that you can't start class until he/she has a piece of cake. Keep asking people when the strippers are going to arrive. <br>Hide somewhere inside the classroom.

Sit down and be quiet for the rest of class. <br>If you have an early morning class, get there before anyone else, and bring a pillow, some blankets, an air mattress, and an alarm clock. Wear your pajamas. Lie down on the air mattress with the pillow and the blankets and act like you're asleep. Have the alarm set for about two minutes into class. When it goes off, preferably very loudly, hit the "snooze" button and go back to sleep. Keep doing so for the duration of the class. <br>Instead of taking notes, do an abstract painting during every class. Call the paintings things like, "Professor Acting Like Mr. Know-It-All" or "Idiot Who Doesn't Know What The Hell He's Talking About." Give the paintings to your professor as gifts. <br>Keep "accidentally" setting fires at your desk. Burn notebooks, papers, or whatever you have handy. Whenever you start a fire, no matter how small it is, start yelling, "Fire! Fire!" and run out of the room in a panic. Don't return for the rest of class. <br>Show up to class about ten minutes late. Ride into the room on a bicycle, yell, "Look out!" and crash into the blackboard. Get up, take a seat, and act like nothing happened. Do this every day. <br>Sit way at the back of the room, up against the wall, to get as far away from your professor as possible. While he/she is lecturing, shout out things like, "What!?" and "Speak up! You're mumbling!" If your professor advises you to sit closer to the front, tell him/her you can't because you're scouting the room for "assassins." <br>Start asking questions in a fake foreign language. Act like your professor is stupid for not being able to understand you. Get other people in the class to start speaking the fake language too, and have frequent discussions during class. Act like you're really interested in what you're discussing. If your professor tries to interrupt or stop you, act annoyed and motion for him/her to quiet down.<br>Tell your professor that you'd like to interview him/her for a writing class. Get him/her to tell you his/her life story. Act interested, and write down everything he/she says. Fabricate a few romantic interludes and turn your efforts into a trashy romance novel. Make copies for the entire class, and your professor. Demand extra credit. <br>Wait for your professor to mention a date, and then yell out, "Bingo!" Apologize, and explain that you got confused. <br>When you have to write a paper, get it done early and mail it to your professor's house. From then on, don't hand anything in, and blame it on the sluggishness of the U.S. Postal Service. <br>When your professor gives you a syllabus, take it home, correct it, give it a grade, and return it to the professor. Demand extra credit. <br>Wrap yourself in bandages and come to class in a wheelchair. Throughout class, cry a lot and moan things like, "Why me?" and "Please kill me!" Get up during class, like your going to miraculously start walking. Instead, fall down, cry out in pain, and wait for someone to help you back up. When class is over say, "I feel better now," leap up, and run home. <br>Write down everything that your professor says, word for word. Think up a melody, and turn the words into a song. Bring a guitar to class and perform the song for the class. Explain to your professor that he/she is "very inspiring." <br>Write your professor a note that says, "I'm going to be about 15 minutes late. Go ahead and start without me." Wait outside the building until the time when class is supposed to begin. Tie the note to a rock, and throw it through the window.
