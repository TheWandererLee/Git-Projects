  <p class="s">After a project is complete, my clients are often kind <br />
    enough
to   share some feedback on our working <br />
relationship. <br />
Here are a few   appreciated remarks.</p>

  <p><em>&ldquo;We   have been very much impressed by David&rsquo;s </em><br />
  <em>ability to literally read our   minds and deliver a</em><br />
  <em> corporate identity that perfectly symbolizes our</em><br />
  <em> vision and conveys the stylish, elegant and modern<br />
  </em><em> image we needed to   sustain the international</em><br />
  <em> development of our company.&rdquo;</em><br />

  <p><em>&ldquo;We were looking for a logo with a touch of modernism.   <br />
    David grasped our needs and produced a stunning design. <br />
    When feedback   was needed, new versions of the logo or <br />
    any modifications were made very   quickly. We really <br />
    appreciated David&rsquo;s flexibility and efficiency. It&rsquo;s   great <br />
    to work with someone so open-minded and responsive. <br />
    Thank you!&rdquo;</em><br />

  <p><em>&ldquo;We   had been in quest of a graphic designer for several <br />
  months, but the few   ones I got in touch with never <br />
  seemed able to meet our taste. Finally,   when I discovered <br />
  David through a Google search, it appeared likely that   <br />
  such a passionate designer would be the partner we had <br />
  been looking for   — which became obvious as soon as we <br />
  started working together. After   reviewing our <br />
  requirements, David sent us a few proposals and, taking   <br />
  great care, created numerous modifications. We were <br />
  plainly satisfied.   Most importantly, each modification <br />
  introduced that special detail that   makes all the difference. <br />
  Needless to say we are extremely satisfied   with the results. <br />
  Thanks David.&rdquo;</em></p>
