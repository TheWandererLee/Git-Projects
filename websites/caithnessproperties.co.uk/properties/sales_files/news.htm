          <TD id=newsContent1 colSpan=2>The NAEA has revealed its predictions 
            for the UK property market over the next 12 months. They have 
            indicated that 2012 will see a 'gradual' recovery as it continues to 
            bounce along with no great upturn to mark a change from the previous 
            12 months. Mr Bolton King said 'I don't believe that we will see a 
            significant fall in house prices over the next 12 months as some 
            have feared, but equally it is unlikely we will see any great upturn 
            to help the market back to full capacity. It is likely that property 
            transactions will remain at a similar level to that in 
        2011'.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

        <TR>
          <TD id=newsContent1 colSpan=2>MARKET COMMENTARY JULY 2011 At the 
            beginning of this year I gave details of our residential property 
            sales for 2010 which amounted to 50 million pounds, being 193 sales 
            where contracts had been exchanged between January and December with 
            an average selling price of £245,500 per property. As we move into 
            the second half of 2011 conducting the same exercise for the first 
            six months of this year, we have sold i.e, exchanged contracts, on 
            approximately 15 million pounds worth of sales representing 68 
            properties with an average selling price of approximately £220,000. 
            2011 has therefore shown a very slow start, partly attributable to 
            the poor weather at the beginning of the year but more to do with 
            the general economic climate and the uncertainty that has prevailed. 
            The first half of 2010 by comparison was far more active with a much 
            higher volume of sales being agreed but the market slowed down in 
            the second half. This year I believe the opposite may apply i.e, 
            poor first half and stronger second half. This seems to be much the 
            case as the last couple of months has seen a considerable 
            improvement to the extent that our pipeline of sales at the 30th 
            June, i.e, the halfway point, showed a further 56 properties under 
            offer but not exchanged with a total sales value of 16 million 
            pounds and an average sale price per property of £287,000. It seems 
            to me that the upturn occurred following the Royal Wedding on the 
            29th April and a general feeling of well being has emanated from 
            this grand occasion. I am now reasonably hopeful that we will 
            achieve last years volume of sales overall and possibly exceed the 
            50 million pound total. As estate agents the encouraging factor is 
            that we now have available a much higher number of instructions than 
            at the same time last year giving prospective purchasers a much 
            wider choice in a varied price range at the present time. Obviously 
            a key factor if vendors wish to sell is the pricing of the property 
            correctly in the first place as in general terms prices are flat and 
            not moving either upwards or downwards. Time will tell what happens 
            following the holiday period that we are now entering. Mike Young

            Surveyors have reported that confidence in the housing market has 
            improved since the end of last year but remains fragile with a 
            strong regional dimension. Confidence in London and the South East 
            is more upbeat that in many other parts of the country. May still

          <TD id=newsContent1 colSpan=2>As we enter the New Year 2011 I always 
            look back at the results for the previous year to see how we as a 
            business have faired over the previous twelve months in order to 
            take a view going forward as to what we can expect in the current 
            year. Obviously the residential market in Cardiff as with the rest 
            of the UK has been challenging over recent years and has been 
            difficult since September 2007, when the Northern Rock situation 
            arose, followed by the recession. Since that time there has been a 
            fall in prices, although I am of the opinion that in general prices 
            remained fairly static last year. Overall there were not many 
            transactions in 2010 compared with the "heady days prior to 2007". 
            This firm sold, i.e. exchanged contracts, on just under £50 
            million&nbsp;pounds worth of residential property, namely flats, 
            bungalows and houses between January and December. This represented 
            199 sales between our three offices covering the whole of Cardiff, 
            giving an average selling price of £245,463. The prices ranged from 
            £86,000 for a retirement apartment in Radyr to £850,000 for a new 
            build five bedroomed family house in Cyncoed and represented sales 
            of four properties being sold a week throughout the year. This 
            factor in itself would dispel any theory that the residential 
            property market was extremely quiet during the last year. It is my 
            opinion that the key factor when selling property is realistic 
            pricing in the first place. It is common knowledge that estate 
            agents tend to over value to gain instructions, as without 
            instructions they have nothing to sell. However, when house prices 
            are static or may be falling, then this works to the disadvantage of 
            the vendor, who in many cases would have achieved a higher price and 
            an earlier sale if they had been more realistic at the outset. The 
            old adage certainly applies that "the best price is usually achieved 
            on a sale of a property in the first few weeks that is placed on the 
            market, and not after the property has been exposed to the market 
            for a year or more. This would appear to certainly apply to 
            properties on the market for in excess of £1,000,000, a figure which 
            appears to be commonly asked in Cardiff but rarely achieved.&nbsp;
