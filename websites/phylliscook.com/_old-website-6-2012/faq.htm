                <strong><font size="2">What are periodontal diseases?</font></strong><br>
                The word periodontal literally means &quot;around the tooth.&quot; 
                Periodontal diseases are serious bacterial infections that destroy 
                the attachment fibers and supporting bone that hold your teeth 
                in your mouth. Left untreated, these diseases can lead to tooth 
                loss. <br>
                <br>
                There are many forms of periodontal disease: <br>
                Gingivitis <br>
                Aggressive periodontitis <br>
                Chronic periodontitis <br>
                Periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases <br>
                Necrotizing periodontal diseases <br>
                <br>
                <strong><font size="2">Who is a periodontist?</font></strong><br>
                A periodontist is a dentist who specializes in the prevention, 
                diagnosis and treatment of periodontal disease and in the placement 
                of dental implants. Periodontists receive extensive training in 
                these areas, including three additional years of education beyond 
                dental school. Periodontists are familiar with the latest techniques 
                for diagnosing and treating periodontal disease. In addition, 
                they can perform cosmetic periodontal procedures to help you achieve 
                the smile you desire. Often, dentists refer their patients to 
                a periodontist when their periodontal disease is advanced. However, 
                you don't need a referral to see a periodontist. In fact, there 
                are occasions when you may choose to go directly to a periodontist 
                or to refer a family member or friend to your own periodontist.<br>
                <br>
                <font size="2"><strong>Is there a relationship between tobacco 
                use and periodontal disease?</strong></font><br>
                Studies have shown that tobacco use may be one of the most significant 
                risk factors in the development and progression of periodontal 
                disease. Smokers are much more likely than non-smokers to have 
                calculus form on their teeth, have deeper pockets between the 
                teeth and gums and lose more of the bone and tissue that support 
                the teeth.<br>
                More about tobacco use and periodontal disease <br>
                <br>
                <font size="2"><strong>Is it normal for my gums to bleed when 
                I brush my teeth?</strong></font><br>
                Bleeding gums are one of the signs of gum disease. Think of gum 
                tissue as the skin on your hand. If your hands bled every time 
                you washed them, you would know something was wrong. There are 
                a number of other warning signs of gum disease.<br>
                <br>
                <font size="2"><strong>What are pockets?</strong></font><br>
                Your bone and gum tissue should fit snugly around your teeth like 
                a turtleneck around your neck. When you have periodontal disease, 
                this supporting tissue and bone is destroyed, forming &quot;pockets&quot; 
                around the teeth. Over time, these pockets become deeper, providing 
                a larger space in which bacteria can live. As bacteria develop 
                around the teeth, they can accumulate and advance under the gum 
                tissue. These deep pockets collect even more bacteria, resulting 
                in further bone and tissue loss. Eventually, if too much bone 
                is lost, the teeth will need to be extracted.<br>
                <br>
                <font size="2"><strong>Could my periodontal disease be genetic?</strong></font><br>
                Research proves that up to 30% of the population may be genetically 
                susceptible to gum disease. Despite aggressive oral care habits, 
                these people may be six times more likely to develop periodontal 
                disease. Identifying these people with a genetic test before they 
                even show signs of the disease and getting them into early interventive 
                treatment may help them keep their teeth for a lifetime.<br>
                <br>
                <font size="2"><strong>Can I pass my periodontal disease to others?</strong></font><br>
                Periodontal disease may be passed from parents to children and 
                between couples, according to an article in the September 1997 
                issue of the Journal of the American Dental Association. Researchers 
                suggest that bacteria causing periodontal disease are passed though 
                saliva. This means that when a family or couple come into contact 
                with each other's saliva, they're at risk for contracting the 
                periodontal disease of another family member. Based on this research, 
                the American Academy of Periodontology recognizes that treatment 
                of gum disease may involve entire families. If one family member 
                has periodontal disease, the AAP recommends that all family members 
                see a dental professional for a periodontal disease screening. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <font size="2"><strong>What can I do to avoid periodontal disease?</strong></font><br>
                To keep your teeth for a lifetime, you must remove the plaque 
                from your teeth and gums every day with proper brushing and flossing. 
                Regular dental visits are also important. Daily cleaning will 
                help keep calculus formation to a minimum, but it won't completely 
                prevent it. A professional cleaning at least twice a year is necessary 
                to remove calculus from places your toothbrush and floss may have 
                missed.<br>
                <br>
                <font size="2"><strong>I'm over 55. Does this mean I'm more likely 
                to get periodontal disease?</strong></font><br>
                Your chances of developing periodontal disease increase considerably 
                as you get older. More than half of people aged 55 and older have 
                periodontitis. The good news is that research suggests that these 
                higher rates may be related to risk factors other than age. So, 
                periodontal disease is not an inevitable part of aging. Risk factors 
                that may make older people more susceptible include general health 
                status, diminished immune status, medications, depression, worsening 
                memory, diminished salivary flow, functional impairments and change 
                in financial status.<br>
                <br>
                <font size="2"><strong>When should I see a periodontist?</strong></font><br>
                If you value your oral as well as overall health, anytime is a 
                good time to see a periodontist for a periodontal evaluation. 
                Sometimes the only way to detect periodontal disease is through 
                a periodontal evaluation. A periodontal evaluation may be especially 
                important in the following situations:<br>
                <br>
                If you notice any symptoms of periodontal disease, including: 
                <br>
                gums that bleed easily, such as during brushing or flossing <br>
                red, swollen or tender gums <br>
                gums that have pulled away from the teeth <br>
                persistent bad breath <br>
                pus between the teeth and gums <br>
                loose or separating teeth <br>
                a change in the way your teeth fit together when you bite <br>
                <br>
                <strong><font size="2">What kinds of oral care products should 
                I use?</font></strong><br>
                Here are some guidelines for choosing dental care products &#8211; 
                what works for most patients most of the time. To find out what 
                is best for your particular needs, talk to your periodontist. 
                Begin with the right equipment &#8211; a soft bristled toothbrush 
                that allows you to reach every surface of each tooth. If the bristles 
                on your toothbrush are bent or frayed, buy a new one. A worn-out 
                brush will not clean your teeth properly. In addition to manual 
                toothbrushes, your choices include automatic toothbrushes and 
                &quot;high tech&quot; electronic toothbrushes. These are safe 
                and effective for the majority of patients. Oral irrigators (water 
                spraying devices) will not remove plaque from your teeth unless 
                used in conjunction with brushing and flossing. Another aid is 
                the rubber tip, often found on the handle end of a toothbrush 
                used to massage the gums after brushing and flossing. Other options 
                include interproximal toothbrushes (tiny brushes that clean plaque 
                between teeth) and interdental cleaners (small sticks or picks 
                that remove plaque between teeth). If used improperly, these dental 
                aids can injure the gums, so it is important to discuss proper 
                use with your periodontist. <br>
