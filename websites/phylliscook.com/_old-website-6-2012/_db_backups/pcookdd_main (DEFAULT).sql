('firstVisit', 'Your First Visit', 'During your first visit, your periodontist will review your complete medical and dental history with you. It&#039;s extremely important for your periodontist to know if you are taking any medications or being treated for any condition that can affect your periodontal care. \r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be given a complete oral and periodontal exam. Your periodontist will examine your gums, check to see if there is any gum line recession, assess how your teeth fit together when you bite and check your teeth to see if any are loose. Your periodontist will also take a small measuring instrument and place it between your teeth and gums to determine the depth of those spaces, known as periodontal pockets. This helps your periodontist assess the health of your gums. Radiographs (x-rays) may be used to show the bone levels between your teeth to check for possible bone loss.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please assist us at the time of your initial visit to the office by providing the following information:\r\n\r\nYour referral slip and x-rays from your referring dentist.\r\nA list of medications you are currently taking (please note that you can fill out your patient registration and medical history form on our website.)\r\nIf you have dental insurance, please bring any forms or insurance cards with you to the appointment.\r\nPlease Note: All patients under 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian at the consultation appointment.\r\n\r\nPlease notify the office if you have a medical condition or concern prior to surgery (e.g. artificial heart valves or joints, heart murmurs requiring pre-medication, severe diabetes, or hypertension).\r\n\r\nWe will complete an in-depth medical and dental health history and a thorough examination to measure for bone loss, loose teeth, bite, oral cancer screening, TMJ, and other signs of periodontal disease.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will It Hurt?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nWe will be as gentle as possible. The periodontal exam can be completed with little or no discomfort.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do I Need X-Rays?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nWe will need current periodontal x-rays in order to see disease not otherwise visible. If your referring dentist has taken x-rays, you may request that they be forwarded to us.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Will It Cost?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nSince all patients are different, your periodontist must complete your examination before establishing your treatment plan and the fee for care. The fee for periodontal treatment can vary considerably depending on the type of problems and the complexity and length of treatment. An approximate fee can usually be determined at the initial visit; but on occasion, some initial treatment or further diagnostics must be completed before the final treatment plan can be established. Our philosophy of practice is to treat as conservatively as possible to attain treatment goals\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will My Insurance Cover The Cost?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nDental insurance policies often cover periodontal treatment. Please bring all medical and dental benefit information and cards to your examination appointment. Upon request, we will submit a claim to predetermine your insurance benefits; however, this is not required by most plans.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will I Need Surgery?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nNot everyone needs periodontal surgery. If treated early, gum disease can be controlled without surgery. We will make recommendations based on your individual situation. Our philosophy of practice is to treat as conservatively as possible to attain treatment goals\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can My Teeth Be Saved?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThe recent advances in periodontal treatment allow us to successfully treat most teeth.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When Will I Go Back To My General Dentist?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nOur office and your dentist will work closely together. If crowns and fillings are needed your dentist will provide them. Regular visits to your dentist are an important part of periodontal maintenance.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What If I Don&#039;t Have Gum Treatment?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nPeriodontal disease is a progressive, painless infection. Delay can cause you further bone loss and more expense. If your teeth are lost, dentures are never as effective as your own teeth.'),

You know \r\n                that these needs change with your body; during puberty, pregnancy, \r\n                or menopause, for example, and require you to take special care \r\n                of yourself or to seek advice from a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n              &lt;p&gt;As your health care needs change, your oral care needs change, \r\n                too. That&#039;s because your oral health and overall health are connected. \r\n                Hormonal fluctuations throughout a woman&#039;s life can affect many \r\n                tissues, including gum tissue.

Any periodontal disease you may develop can be more severe \r\n              and harder to control. Preventing or controlling periodontal disease \r\n              requires ongoing care. &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Causes Gum Infections?&lt;br&gt;\r\n                &lt;/strong&gt;Bacteria in your mouth form a sticky, whitish film, called \r\n                plaque, on teeth. If plaque is not removed daily, it can harden \r\n                into a rough yellow or brown deposit called tartar.&lt;br&gt;\r\n                &lt;br&gt;\r\n                Tartar is harder to remove from your teeth than plaque.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n              &lt;p&gt;Bacteria from plaque and tartar can cause swollen, infected, \r\n                and receding gums. More severe gum and bone disease may then occur.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n              &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention&lt;br&gt;\r\n                &lt;/strong&gt;You can do some simple things that can help prevent periodontal \r\n                disease. Follow these guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n              &lt;p&gt;Use Good Oral Hygiene&lt;/p&gt;\r\n              &lt;p&gt;Brush your teeth after each meal and floss daily.

('insurance', 'Insurance Information', '&lt;p&gt;Our insurance coordinators deal with many different insurance companies. Some companies offer many different dental and medical plans. These companies can change benefits, co-pays, and deductibles many times throughout the year. We do our best to provide you with accurate coverage estimates based on information available to us. At times, it is almost impossible to accurately estimate a patient&acirc;€™s insurance co-payment. Many insurance companies will not give out fees until after the treatment is completed. Dealing with these companies can be difficult and time consuming. As a courtesy, we ask that you keep us informed of any change to your insurance. It is important that all information about you and your insurance is current.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Although we will gladly file a claim on your behalf, you may wish to submit the claim yourself. In general, insurers process claims filed directly by patients faster than those filed by the service providers (dental offices).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Further, most dental insurance policies are limited and often only pay for a portion of the procedure(s) that may need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;h2&gt;Co-Payment&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The majority of dental plans reimburse approximately 30-80 percent of treatment costs. With this in mind, we ask that 20 percent of the fee be paid at the time of treatment. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h2&gt;HMO Patients&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;If a patient comes to us with a problem that they expect to be covered by medical insurance (biopsies, tumors, TMJ, infections), they must have a referral from their primary care physician. A referral from a dentist is not adequate for medical insurance coverage. Obtaining a medical referral is the patient&#039;s responsibility. We cannot obtain the referral for you and the referral cannot be obtained retroactively. If you do not have a referral, we will be happy to see you on a cash basis, but your medical insurance company will not pay for your treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h2&gt; Medicare&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Medicare pays us directly for your care. You are responsible for any deductible and co-insurance. Dental procedures (root planing, implants) are not covered by Medicare. If Medicare denies your procedure, you are responsible for the charges.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;h2&gt;Private &amp;amp; Group Insurance&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;As a courtesy to our patients with medical and/or dental benefit plans, we will submit necessary claim forms, receipts, and other information to your insurance company. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Upon receipt of an insurance payment, any balance due will be billed to you.

They are designed to help you minimize post-surgical discomfort and inform you of any situation that may require special attention.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Pain Medications&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;p&gt; It is not unusual to have discomfort for at least the first week following your surgical procedure. You will be given a prescription for medication to help you tolerate the post-surgical recovery period. Please take your medications as directed. If necessary, you may take your pain medication more frequently than every 4-6 hours to stay ahead of the soreness. It is advisable to not take pain medication on an empty stomach, as nausea may result.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;As an alternative to prescription medications, some patients have found taking a combination of over the counter Ibuprofen and Tylenol to be effective. You may take the combination in either of the following dosages: 3 Advil Liqui-Gels and 2 Regular Strength Tylenol or 3 Advil Liqui-Gels and 1 Extra Strength Tylenol, every 4-6 hours as needed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; When taking any prescribed medication containing Acetaminophen (Tylenol), i.e.; Percocet, Hydrocodone, Vicoden or Tylenol with Codeine, you should not take additional Tylenol so as not to exceed the safety level of Acetaminophen. Please contact the office with any questions you may have.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; An antibiotic may be prescribed following your surgical procedure. Take as directed until gone. It is advisable not to take these medications on an empty stomach, as nausea may result. For women taking birth control pills, be advised that antibiotics may interfere with their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Swelling&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; Swelling may occur following your surgical procedure and will typically increase 2-3 days after the procedure. To minimize the swelling, place an ice pack over the outside cheek area for 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off. Continue using ice for 2-3 days following the procedure as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Bleeding&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; A small amount of bleeding is normal. If excessive or continuous bleeding occurs:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;ul&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt; Do not rinse your mouth.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;li&gt;Elevate your head when lying down.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;Apply moistened gauze to the immediate area with moderate pressure for 20 minutes, repeat if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;Enclose a moistened tea bag in a gauze square and apply pressure for 20 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;Call the office if bleeding persists.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Dressing&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;p&gt;The dressing (which acts as a bandage) is used to protect the surgical site and help reduce discomfort. If the dressing comes off or is uncomfortable, please call the office for direction.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Diet&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Until comfortable, avoid chewing on the side where surgery was completed. Avoid hot foods and liquids for approximately 1 hour following the surgery so as not to soften the dressing. A soft diet is recommended. Foods such as cottage cheese, oatmeal, soup, eggs, yogurt, pasta, mashed potatoes, casseroles, and fruits are more easily eaten. Remember, adequate nutrition is essential for feeling better as well as for healing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Smoking&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Do not smoke for at least 2 weeks following your surgical procedure. It will significantly slow healing and can compromise results.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Do not drink alcohol while taking prescription pain medications.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Rinsing&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Do not rinse for the first 24 hours. After that, you may use a mild, diluted mouthwash. Repeat as necessary to help keep the dressing clean.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Brushing&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;Do not brush the surgical site. You may resume normal brushing/flossing in other areas the following day.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Suture Removal&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;p&gt;You may notice increased discomfort 3-4 days after the surgical procedure. As the tissues begin to heal, they may pull against the sutures and dressing.  You may choose to take some form of pain medication one hour prior to your suture removal appointment to minimize tenderness. ***If you are a patient for whom Antibiotic Pre-Medication is required, take the prescribed antibiotics 1 hour prior to your suture removal appointment.***&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;h3&gt;Contact Us&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; Should you have any questions or concerns during regular office hours, please do not hesitate to contact us at 910-256-8486'),

When your gums become unhealthy, they can either recede or become swollen and red.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In later stages, the supporting bone is destroyed and your teeth will shift, loosen, or fall out.

('aboutPeriodontalDisease', 'About Periodontal Disease', 'Periodontal diseases are infections of the gums that gradually destroy the support of your natural teeth. Dental plaque is the primary cause of gum disease in genetically-susceptible individuals. Bacteria found in plaque produce toxins or poisons that irritate the gums. They may cause them to turn red, swell, and bleed easily. If this irritation is prolonged, the gums separate from the teeth causing pockets (spaces) to form. Plaque can also harden into a rough, porous substance known as calculus (or tartar). This can occur both above and below the gum line.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As periodontal diseases progress, the supporting gum tissue and bone that holds teeth in place deteriorate. If left untreated, this leads to tooth loss.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, don&acirc;€™t be fooled. With periodontal disease, bleeding, redness, and swelling do not have to be present. Further, pain is usually not associated with periodontal disease. This disease damages the teeth, gum, and jawbone of more than 80 percent of Americans by age 45.');

('preventingGumDisease', 'Preventing Gum Disease', '&lt;p&gt;Adults over the age of 35 lose more teeth to gum diseases than from cavities. Three out of four adults are affected at some time in their life. The best way to prevent cavities and &lt;a href=&quot;?aboutPeriodontalDisease&quot;&gt;Periodontal Diseases&lt;/a&gt; is by daily thorough &lt;a href=&quot;?oralHygiene&quot;&gt;tooth brushing and flossing techniques&lt;/a&gt; and regular professional examinations and cleanings. Unfortunately, even with the most diligent home dental care, people still can develop some form of &lt;a href=&quot;?aboutPeriodontalDisease&quot;&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt;. Once this disease starts, professional intervention is necessary to prevent its progress. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h3&gt;Other important factors affecting the health of your gums include:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n          &lt;ul&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;li&gt;	Tobacco usage&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;	Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;Stress&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;	Clenching and grinding teeth&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;	Medication&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;li&gt;	Poor nutrition &lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;The Perioscope&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;This is a new technology developed for the treatment of &lt;a href=&quot;?aboutPeriodontalDisease&quot;&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt;. The perioscope is an endoscope that has been specifically designed to explore and visualize the pocket (space) under the gum of teeth involved with periodontitis. An image on a computer monitor shows the diseased tooth&#039;s root surface. The perioscope enables the clinician to see the contents of the periodontal pocket and to analyze the root surface of the tooth for disease, causing bacterial accumulations (plaque and calculus).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;The perioscope guides the clinician during the process of cleaning the root surface free of plaque and calculus - the treatment for periodontitis. It also allows the clinician to identify other problems (cracks, perforations and other disease-causing flaws of the tooth root&#039;s surface) that are located under the gum - previously requiring surgery to detect.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;Periodontal Disease &amp;amp; Tobacco&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;You are probably familiar with the links between tobacco use and lung disease, cancer, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Current studies have now linked periodontal disease with tobacco usage.  These cases may be even more severe than those of non-users of tobacco.  There is a greater incidence of calculus formation on teeth, deeper pockets between gums and teeth as well as greater loss of the bone and fibers that hold teeth in your mouth.  In addition, your chance of developing oral cancer increases with the use of smokeless tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Chemicals in tobacco such as nicotine and tar slow down healing and the predictability of success following periodontal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h3&gt;Problems caused by tobacco include:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Lung disease, heart disease, cancer, mouth sores, gum recession, loss of bone and teeth, bad breath, tooth staining, less success with periodontal treatment, and with &lt;a href=&quot;?dentalImplants&quot;&gt;dental implants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Quitting tobacco will reduce the chance of developing the above problems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;Diabetes &amp;amp; Oral Health&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Individuals suffering from diabetes, especially uncontrolled diabetics, have a higher risk of developing bacterial infections of the mouth. These infections may impair your ability to process insulin, resulting in greater difficulty with controlling your diabetes. &lt;a href=&quot;?aboutPeriodontalDisease&quot;&gt;Periodontal diseases&lt;/a&gt; will be more severe than those of a non-diabetic and treatment more difficult.  However, well-controlled diabetics have a lower incidence of cavities.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Steps to prevent &lt;a href=&quot;?aboutPeriodontalDisease&quot;&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=&quot;?oralHygiene&quot;&gt;daily brushing and flossing&lt;/a&gt; to remove plaque from your teeth and gums, regular dental visits for professional cleaning, and regular periodontal evaluation. Your health professional must also be told of your history and the current status of your condition.

At these times, the chance of &lt;a href=&quot;?aboutPeriodontalDisease&quot;&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt; may increase, requiring special care of your oral health.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;Puberty &lt;/h2&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;During puberty, there is increased production of sex hormones.  These higher levels increase gum sensitivity and lead to greater irritations from plaque and food particles. The gums can become swollen, turn red, and feel tender. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;Menstruation &lt;/h2&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Similar symptoms occasionally appear several days before menstruation.  There can be bleeding of the gums, bright red swelling between the teeth and gum, or sores on the inside of the cheek.  The symptoms clear up once the period has started. As the amount of sex hormones decrease, so do these problems.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Your gums and teeth are also affected during pregnancy.  Between the second and eighth month, your gums may also swell, bleed, and become red or tender.  Large lumps may appear as a reaction to local irritants.  However, these growths are generally painless and not cancerous.  They may require professional removal, but usually disappear after pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Periodontal health should be part of your prenatal care.  Any infections during pregnancy, including periodontal infections, can place a baby&#039;s health at risk.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent periodontic infections is to begin with healthy gums and continue to maintain your oral health with proper home care and careful periodontic monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;Oral Contraceptives&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Swelling, bleeding, and tenderness of the gums may also occur when you are taking oral contraceptives, which are synthetic hormones. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;You must mention any prescriptions you are taking, including oral contraceptives, prior to medical or dental treatment.  This will help eliminate the risk of drug interactions, such as antibiotics with oral contraceptives - where the effectiveness of the contraceptive can be lessened. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;Menopause&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Changes in the look and feel of your mouth may occur if you are menopausal or post-menopausal.  They include feeling pain and burning in your gum tissue and salty, peppery, or sour tastes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Careful &lt;a href=&quot;?oralHygiene&quot;&gt;oral hygiene&lt;/a&gt; at home and professional cleaning may relieve these symptoms. There are also saliva substitutes to treat the effects of dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;'),
('oralHygiene', 'Oral Hygiene', '&lt;p&gt;While brushing the outside surfaces of your teeth, position the brush at a 45-degree angle where your gums and teeth meet. Gently move the brush in a circular motion several times using small, gentle strokes. Use light pressure while putting the bristles between the teeth, but not so much pressure that you feel any discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;When you are done cleaning the outside surfaces of all your teeth, follow the same directions while cleaning the inside of the back teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;To clean the inside surfaces of the upper and lower front teeth, hold the brush vertically. Make several gentle back-and-forth strokes over each tooth. Don&#039;t forget to gently brush the surrounding gum tissue.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Next you will clean the biting surfaces of your teeth. To do this use short, gentle strokes. Change the position of the brush as often as necessary to reach and clean all surfaces. Try to watch yourself in the mirror to make sure you clean each surface. After you are done, rinse vigorously to remove any plaque you might have loosened while brushing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any pain while brushing or have any questions about how to brush properly, please be sure to call the office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;How to Floss&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;?aboutPeriodontalDisease&quot;&gt;Periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt; usually appears between the teeth where your toothbrush cannot reach. Flossing is a very effective way to remove plaque from those surfaces. However, it is important to develop the proper technique. The following instructions will help you, but remember it takes time and practice.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Start with a piece of floss (waxed is easier) about 18&quot; long. Lightly wrap most of the floss around the middle finger of one hand. Wrap the rest of the floss around the middle finger of the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;p&gt;To clean the upper teeth, hold the floss tightly between the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Gently insert the floss tightly between the teeth using a back-and-forth motion. Do not force the floss or try to snap it in to place. Bring the floss to the gum line then curve it into a C-shape against one tooth. Slide it into the space between the gum and the tooth until you feel light resistance. Move the floss up and down on the side of one tooth. Remember there are two tooth surfaces that need to be cleaned in each space. Continue to floss each side of all the upper teeth. Be careful not to cut the gum tissue between the teeth. As the floss becomes soiled, turn from one finger to the other to get a fresh section.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;To clean between the bottom teeth, guide the floss using the forefinger of both hands. Do not forget the backside of the last tooth on both sides, upper and lower.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;When you are done, rinse vigorously with water to remove plaque and food particles. Do not be alarmed if during the first week of flossing your gums bleed or are a little sore. If your gums hurt while flossing you could be doing it too hard or pinching the gum. As you floss daily and remove the plaque your gums will heal and the bleeding should stop.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;Caring For Sensitive Teeth&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Sometimes after dental treatment, teeth are sensitive to hot and cold. This should not last long, but only if the mouth is kept clean. If the mouth is not kept clean the sensitivity will remain and could become more severe. If your teeth are especially sensitive, consult with your doctor. They may recommend a medicated toothpaste or mouth rinse made especially for sensitive teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;h2&gt;Choosing Oral Hygiene Products&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;p&gt;There are so many products on the market it can become confusing and choosing between all the products can be difficult. Here are some suggestions for choosing dental care products that will work for most patients.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Automatic and &quot;high-tech&quot; electronic toothbrushes are safe and effective for the majority of the patients. Oral irrigators (water spraying devices) will rinse your mouth thoroughly, but will not remove plaque. You need to brush and floss in conjunction with the irrigator. We see excellent results with electric toothbrushes called Rotadent and Interplak.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Some toothbrushes have a rubber tip on the handle, this is used to massage the gums after brushing. There are also tiny brushes (interproximal toothbrushes) that clean between your teeth. If these are used improperly you could injure the gums, so discuss proper use with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;If used in conjunction with brushing and flossing, fluoride toothpastes and mouth rinses can reduce tooth decay as much as 40 percent. Remember, these rinses are not recommended for children under six years of age. Tartar control toothpastes will reduce tartar above the gum line, but gum disease starts below the gum line so these products have not been proven to reduce the early stage of gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;Anti-plaque rinses, approved by the American Dental Association, contain agents that may help bring early gum disease under control.

('oralPathology', 'Oral Pathology', '&lt;p&gt;The inside of the mouth is normally lined with a special type of skin (mucosa) that is smooth and coral pink in color. Any alteration in this appearance could be a warning sign for a pathological process. The most serious of these is oral cancer. The following can be signs at the beginning of a pathologic process or cancerous growth: &lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;ul&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;	Reddish patches (erythroplasia) or whitish patches (leukoplakia) in the mouth.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;li&gt;A sore that fails to heal and bleeds easily.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;A lump or thickening on the skin lining the inside of the mouth.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;Chronic sore throat or hoarseness.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;Difficulty in chewing or swallowing.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt;These changes can be detected on the lips, cheeks, palate, and gum tissue around the teeth, tongue, face, and/or neck. Pain does not always occur with pathology and, curiously, is not often associated with oral cancer. However, any patient with facial and/or oral pain without an obvious cause or reason may also be at risk for oral cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;p&gt;We would recommend performing an oral cancer self-examination monthly and remember that your mouth is one of your body&#039;s most important warning systems.

('treatmentMethods', 'Treatment Methods', 'Dr. Cook&acirc;€™s practice provides a variety of surgical services. We pride ourselves on the fact that we are very conservative in our treatment recommendations and limit surgery to the areas where it is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many times, the early stages of periodontal disease are best treated with non-surgical periodontal therapy. Even in severe cases, non-surgical periodontal therapy often precedes surgical therapy. This is done to improve the overall tissue quality prior to surgery and also to help limit the areas requiring surgery.'),
('scalingRootPlaning', 'Scaling and Root Planing', '&lt;p&gt;The initial stage of treatment is usually a thorough cleaning that may include scaling to remove plaque and tartar deposits beneath the gum line.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n		 &lt;p&gt;The tooth roots may also be planed to smooth the root surface allowing the gum tissue to heal and reattach to the tooth. In some cases, the occlusion (bite) may require adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics or irrigation with anti-microbials (chemical agents or mouth rinses) may be recommended to help control the growth of bacteria that create toxins and cause periodontitis. In some cases, Dr. Cook may place antibiotic fibers in the periodontal pockets after scaling and planing. This may be done to control infection and to encourage normal healing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;When deep pockets between teeth and gums are present, it is difficult for Dr. Cook to thoroughly remove plaque and tartar. Patients can seldom, if ever, keep these pockets clean and free of plaque. Consequently, surgery may be needed to restore periodontal health.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;h2&gt;Bite Adjustment&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;A bite is considered to be healthy when all or most of the teeth are present and not destroyed by normal daily usage. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;p&gt;It is destructive when teeth show wear, looseness or when TMJ (jaw joint) damage is seen. Bite therapy helps restore a bite that can function without damage and destruction. The therapy may include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;ul&gt;\r\n           &lt;li&gt;Reshaping the biting surfaces of the teeth and eliminating spots of excessive pressures where the teeth are brought into contact. This is done by carefully dividing bite pressures evenly across all of the teeth. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n           &lt;li&gt;	Bite splint therapy using a custom-fitted and adjusted plastic bite guard to keep the teeth apart, day, night, or both.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n           &lt;li&gt;	Braces to reposition mal-aligned or drifted teeth.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n           &lt;li&gt;Replacement of old, worn out, or damaged fillings.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n           &lt;li&gt;	Reconstruction of badly worn and damaged teeth.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n         &lt;/ul&gt;'),
('dentalImplants', 'Dental Implants', '&lt;p&gt;Dental implants are designed to provide a foundation for replacement teeth that look, feel, and function like natural teeth. The person who has lost teeth regains the ability to eat virtually anything and can smile with confidence, knowing that teeth appear natural and that facial contours will be preserved. The implants themselves are tiny titanium posts that are placed into the jawbone where teeth are missing. The bone bonds with the titanium, creating a strong foundation for artificial teeth. In addition, implants can help preserve facial structure, preventing the bone deterioration that occurs when teeth are missing. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Dental implants are changing the way people live! With them, people are rediscovering the comfort and confidence to eat, speak, laugh, and enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cook has received extensive training in Implantology. Through continuing education, Dr. Cook is abreast of the most current information on implant dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;h2&gt;Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;If, like many others, you feel implant dentistry is the choice for you, we ask that you undergo a dental/radiographic examination and health history. During these consultation visits, your doctor will address your specific needs and considerations. Your questions and concerns are important to us and our team will work with you very closely to help make your procedure a success.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;We will also discuss fees and insurance at this time. There are many types of insurance plans, and coverage for implants is varied. We will be happy to assist you in obtaining any benefits to which you may be entitled.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n              \r\n         &lt;h2&gt;Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n       \r\n         &lt;p&gt;Dental implants are metal anchors that act as tooth root substitutes. They are surgically placed into the jawbone. Small posts are attached to the implant to provide stable anchors in the gums for replacement teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;For most patients, the placement of dental implants involves two surgical procedures. First, implants are placed within your jawbone. Healing time following surgery varies from person to person and is based on a variety of factors that include hardness of bone. In some cases, implants may be restored immediately after they are placed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;For the first three to six months following surgery, the implants are beneath the surface of the gums gradually bonding with the jawbone. You should be able to wear temporary dentures and eat a soft diet during this time. At the same time, your restorative dentist designs the final bridgework or denture that will ultimately improve both function and aesthetics. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;After the implant has bonded to the jawbone, the second phase begins. Dr. Cook will uncover the implants and attach a small healing collar. After two weeks your general dentist will be able to start making your new teeth. An impression must be taken. Then posts or attachments can be connected to the implants. The teeth replacements are then made over the posts or attachments. The entire procedure usually takes six to eight months. Most patients do not experience any disruption in their daily life.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;h2&gt;TEETH-IN-AN-HOUR&acirc;„&cent;&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;TEETH-IN-AN-HOUR&acirc;„&cent; is a revolutionary concept providing patients with fully functioning teeth or dental implants in one single procedure that lasts about an hour. This technology was recently developed by Nobel Biocare and allows for collaboration between both the restorative doctor and the surgeon. This merging of knowledge and experience achieves not only increased safety, but also a more precise implant placement. In addition, the fabrication of a final prosthesis is completed prior to the surgery. The computer-guided implant surgery is done in an arthroscopic fashion without requiring any flap reflection. This benefits the patient in that there is less postoperative discomfort, less swelling, and less bruising. Often patients can resume their normal activities the next day. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;The process starts when a CAT scan is taken of the patient&#039;s jawbone. This CAT scan allows for the generation of a 3-D model of the jawbone that can then be used in virtual reality software to plan the implant placement without the presence of the patient. The results are more accurate implant placement and less chair time for the patient at the surgery office.&lt;/p&gt;'),
('cosmeticPeriodontal', 'Cosmetic Periodontal Surgery', '&lt;p&gt;These procedures are a predictable way to cover unsightly, sensitive, or exposed root surfaces and to prevent future gum recession. If you are unhappy with the appearance of short unsightly teeth this can be greatly improved by a combination of periodontal procedures by Dr. Cook and cosmetic dentistry by your dentist.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n		  \r\n         &lt;p&gt;Although your teeth appear short, they may actually be the proper length. The teeth may be covered with too much gum tissue. We can correct this by performing the periodontal plastic surgery procedure, &lt;a href=&quot;?crownLengthening&quot;&gt;crown lengthening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;During this procedure, excess gum and bone tissue are reshaped to expose more of the natural tooth. This can be done to more than one tooth, to even your gum line, and to create a beautiful smile.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Another cosmetic procedure is the &lt;a href=&quot;?gumGrafting&quot;&gt;soft tissue graft&lt;/a&gt;.  It is used to cover unattractive tooth roots, reduce gum recession, and protect the roots from decay and eventual loss.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Tooth loss causes the jawbone to recede and can lead to an unnatural looking indentation in your gums and jaw, an appearance of a general aging. The original look of your mouth may not be recaptured because of spaces remaining under and between replacement teeth. They may appear too long compared to nearby teeth. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;?boneGrafting&quot;&gt;Bone grafting&lt;/a&gt; following tooth loss can preserve the socket/ridge and minimize gum and bone collapse.  There is less shrinkage and a more aesthetic tooth replacement for either an &lt;a href=&quot;?dentalImplants&quot;&gt;dental implant crown&lt;/a&gt; or fixed bridge around the replacement teeth. &lt;/p&gt;'),
('gumGrafting', 'Gum Grafting', '&lt;p&gt;When recession of the gingiva occurs, the body loses a natural defense against both bacterial penetration and trauma. When gum recession is a problem, gum reconstruction using grafting techniques is an option. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n		 &lt;p&gt;When there is only minor recession, some healthy gingiva often remains and protects the tooth, so that no treatment other than modifying home care practices is necessary. However, when recession reaches the mucosa, the first line of defense against bacterial penetration is lost.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;In addition, gum recession often results in root sensitivity to hot and cold foods as well as an unsightly appearance of the gum and tooth. When significant, gym recession can predispose to worsening recession and expose the root surface, which is softer than enamel, leading to root caries and root gouging.&lt;/p&gt;    \r\n        \r\n         \r\n         &lt;p&gt;A gingival graft is designed to solve these problems. A thin piece of tissue is taken from the roof of the mouth or gently moved over from adjacent areas to provide a stable band of attached gingiva around the tooth. The gingival graft may be placed in such a way as to cover the exposed portion of the root.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;The gingival graft procedure is highly predictable and results in a stable healthy band of attached tissue around the tooth.&lt;/p&gt;'),
('crownLengthening', 'Crown Lengthening', 'Crown lengthening (or crown exposure) is required when your tooth needs a new crown or other restoration. The edge of that restoration is deep below the gum tissue and not accessible. It is also usually too close to the bone or below the bone.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The procedure involves adjusting the level of the gum tissue and bone around the tooth in question to create a new gum-to&acirc;€“tooth relationship. This allows us to reach the edge of the restoration, ensuring a proper fit to the tooth. It should also provide enough tooth structure so the new restoration will not come loose in the future. This allows you to clean the edge of the restoration when you brush and floss to prevent decay and gum disease. The procedure takes approximately one hour.\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the procedure is completed, sutures, and a protective bandage are placed to help secure the new gum-to-tooth relationship. You will need to be seen in one or two weeks to remove the sutures and evaluate your healing. '),
('boneGrafting', 'Bone Grafting', '&lt;h2&gt;Major &amp;amp; Minor Bone Grafting &lt;/h2&gt;\r\n		  &lt;p&gt;Over a period of time, the jawbone associated with missing teeth atrophies or is reabsorbed. This often leaves a condition in which there is poor quality and quantity of bone suitable for placement of &lt;a href=&quot;?dentalImplants&quot;&gt;dental implants&lt;/a&gt;. In these situations, most patients are not candidates for placement of &lt;a href=&quot;?dentalImplants&quot;&gt;dental implants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Today, we have the ability to grow bone where needed. This not only gives us the opportunity to place implants of proper length and width, it also gives us a chance to restore functionality and esthetic appearance. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;h2&gt;Major Bone Grafting&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Bone grafting can repair implant sites with inadequate bone structure due to previous extractions, &lt;a href=&quot;?aboutPeriodontalDisease&quot;&gt;gum disease&lt;/a&gt;, or injuries.  The bone is either obtained from a tissue bank or your own bone is taken from the jaw, hip, or tibia (below the knee.)  Sinus bone grafts are also performed to replace bone in the posterior upper jaw.  In addition, special membranes may be utilized that dissolve under the gum and protect the bone graft and encourage bone regeneration.  This is called &lt;a href=&quot;?otherServices&quot;&gt;guided bone regeneration&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;?otherServices&quot;&gt;guided tissue regeneration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Major bone grafts are typically performed to repair defects of the jaws.  These defects may arise as a result of traumatic injuries, tumor surgery, or congenital defects.  Large defects are repaired using the patient&#039;s own bone.  This bone is harvested from a number of different sites depending on the size of he defect.  The skull (cranium), hip (iliac crest), and lateral knee (tibia) are common donor sites.  These procedures are routinely performed in an operating room and require a hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n         &lt;h2&gt;Sinus Lift Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;The maxillary sinuses are behind your cheeks and on top of the upper teeth.  Sinuses are like empty rooms that have nothing in them.  Some of the roots of the natural upper teeth extend up into the maxillary sinuses.  When these upper teeth are removed, there is often just a thin wall of bone separating the maxillary sinus and the mouth.  &lt;a href=&quot;?dentalImplants&quot;&gt;Dental implants&lt;/a&gt; need bone to hold them in place.  When the sinus wall is very thin, it is impossible to place dental implants in this bone.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         \r\n         &lt;p&gt;There is a solution called a sinus graft or sinus lift graft.  The dental implant surgeon enters the sinus from where the upper teeth used to be.  The sinus membrane is then lifted upward and donor bone is inserted into the floor of the sinus.  Keep in mind that the floor of the sinus is the roof of the upper jaw.  After several months of healing, the bone becomes part of the patient&#039;s jaw and &lt;a href=&quot;?dentalImplants&quot;&gt;dental implants&lt;/a&gt; can be inserted and stabilized in this new sinus bone.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;The sinus graft makes it possible for many patients to have &lt;a href=&quot;?dentalImplants&quot;&gt;dental implants&lt;/a&gt; when years ago there was no other option other than wearing loose dentures.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;p&gt;If enough bone between the upper jaw ridge and the bottom of the sinus is available to stabilize the implant well, sinus augmentations and implant placement can sometimes be performed as a single procedure.  If not enough bone is available, the sinus augmentation will have to be performed first, then the graft will have to mature for several months, depending upon the type of graft material used.  Once the graft has matured, the implants can be placed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;h2&gt;Ridge Expansion&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;In severe cases, the ridge has been reabsorbed and a bone graft is placed to increase ridge height and/or width.  This is a technique used to restore the lost bone dimension when the jaw ridge gets too thin to place conventional implants.  In this procedure, the bony ridge of the jaw is literally expanded by mechanical means.  Bone graft material can be placed and matured for a few months before placing the implant.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;h2&gt;Nerve Repositioning&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;The inferior alveolar nerve which gives feeling to the lower lip and chin may need to be moved in order to make room for placement of dental implants to the lower jaw.  This procedure is limited to the lower jaw and indicated when teeth are missing in the area of the two back molars and/or and second premolar, with the above-mentioned secondary condition.  Since this procedure is considered a very aggressive approach (there is almost always some postoperative numbness of the lower lip and jaw area, which dissipates only very slowly, if ever).  Usually other, less aggressive options are considered first (placement of blade implants, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;Typically we remove an outer section of the cheek side of the lower jawbone in order to expose the nerve and vessel canal.  Then we isolate the nerve and vessel bundle in that area, and slightly pull it out to the side.  At the same time we place the implants, we&#039;ll be tracking the neuro-vascular bundle.  Then the bundle is released and placed back over the implants.  The surgical access is refilled with bone graft material of the surgeon&#039;s choice and the area is closed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;p&gt;These procedures may be performed separately or together depending upon the individual&#039;s condition. As stated earlier, there are several areas of the body that are suitable for attaining bone grafts. In the maxillofacial region, bone grafts can be taken from inside the mouth, in the area of the chin or third molar region or in the upper jaw behind the last tooth. In more extensive situations, a greater quantity of bone can be attained from the hip or the outer aspect of the tibia at the knee.   When we use the patient&#039;s own bone for repairs or addition, we generally get the best results. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;In many cases, we can use allograft material to implement bone grafting for &lt;a href=&quot;?dentalImplants&quot;&gt;dental implants&lt;/a&gt;.  This bone is prepared from cadavers and used to get the patients own bone to grow into the repair site. It is quite effective and very safe. Synthetic materials can also be used to stimulate bone formation.  We even use factors from your own blood to accelerate and promote bone formation in graft areas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n         &lt;p&gt;These surgeries are performed in the out-office surgical suite under IV sedation or general anesthesia. After discharge, bed rest is recommended for one day and limited physical activity for one week.&lt;/p&gt;'),
('otherServices', 'Other Services', '&lt;h2&gt;Guided Tissue Bone Regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nGuided tissue bone regeneration regenerates the previously lost gum and bone tissue.

Other regenerative procedures involve the use of bioactive gels.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Osseous Surgery&lt;/h2&gt;\r\nTraditionally, gum disease is treated by eliminating the gum pockets. The infected gum tissue is trimmed away and uneven bone tissue re-contoured.
