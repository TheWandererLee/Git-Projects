Writing on the Wall
13 pieces of graphic art. Ink on paper.<br />Inspired in response to a teenage artist arrested for putting graffiti on Asheville downtown walls. Graffiti words were collected during travels to Texas, Montana, and North Carolina from bathroom, subway, and city walls. The titles of original art are written in pink fingernail polish which summarize each picture. The presentation of the series is a cry towards the individual expression of self without the criminal act; by using paper, not the walls of other's buildings. Grabbing a sense of responsibility for self as well the other guy.<br />Presently reclaimed pieces of Writing on the Wall series are being transformed and have evolved into art shirts.  If you know or have seen any unposted "Writing on the Wall" pieces 8.5x11 B&W posters done in 1987 please contact me. I would consider it to be a valuable asset in the continuation of this project.
