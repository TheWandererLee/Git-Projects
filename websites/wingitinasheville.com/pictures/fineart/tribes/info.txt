Tribes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a teacher I recognized the need for paintings that portrayed and elevated people of color. Oppresed cultures and minorities are conitnually photographes and visualized through romantic notions of "we" are better off than that. "Superior."<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The he realized -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, in deed am this creation,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I have poured it forth from myself"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an artist I took it upon myself to undress the white race, address notions of prejudice and exemplify oppresed cultures that continue to care for their elderly and children. Initiate their youths through rites of passage, and support the individual and their families in duress. For it is the struggle, the confrontation of the conflict which is the celebration that binds loyalty, and makes Tribes. It is the repetitive process. Sharing celebrations of Nature, Holidays, and Inidividual development are Rituals that produce a sense of Tribe.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we begin to open up to accepting; those who are different than ourself, as our extended family, celebrationg our similarities, as well as our differences we evoke the process of healing, toward personal individuation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and that way he became this creation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and verily he who knows this...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes in this creation...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Creator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original purpose: to create visual stimulus that supports Unity in recognizing similarities even in culutural diversity. To propose that which in the name of Christianity, years ago- Industrialization, at the turn of the century and Capitalism now, proposes to insure actually (has/is) continues to break down that which allows one to feel or live in Tribal Unity. Therefore physically manifesting the breakdown of Tribes as we know them and families as we live in them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the beginning there was only the Great Self<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflected in the form of a Person.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflecting... it found nothing but Itself.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its first word was... This am I."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first painting, "Mother" was inspired by the longing for his family of an African friend. He was seemingly exiled from his family by immigration laws. This desire to be reunited or embraced by the physical family, remains through out life with people of all colors and can only by nurtured and fulfilled by our blood family, or personal resolution.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This African mans desire was similar to my desire to be embreaced by my family. I did not have immigration laws, and oceans separating me from my family. Thus began my quest for Tribe. Resurrecting and healing that which was annihilated and oppresed in my past.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of this work called "tribes" directed a personal need of the expression and feeling during the finding and nurturing of the Tribe. My intrigue lay in the elaborate portrayal of ceremony. The Story where in rituals and initiations were garbed with hand crafts and tokens of personal creation, and experiencel therefore separate family from its members are governed by separateness. To accept only that which is similar to self, is to present and deliver the ultimatum...<br />Division and Oppresion. Or to set similarities, above-or over differences.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I present; that which is blood that goes beyond blood. I have found that which is this supposedly progressive standard of living has in actuality torn apart exactly that which people kind long have to have back; Family unity, Tribal security and Individual respect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mediums used in this series are various sizes of streched canvas' on frames or canvas board with latex and acrylic paints.
