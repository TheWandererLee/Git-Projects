		<br />âThis company is fantastic! They also laid down a covering from the doorway into the house. Every piece of furniture with drawers or doors was wrapped in plastic and then covered with padding when put on the truck. The men were very careful with everything they loaded. When it was time to unload, they covered the full glass panel on the side of our front door and laid the covering on the floor again. They also took a mattress and box spring we had in a bedroom (not part of the move) and put it up into the attic for us. They went above and beyond any mover we had used previously and we have moved 12 times. I would definitely recommend them for any type of move.â

		<br />âMove #6 with East Coast, great job as usual!â -- âThey moved our household goods from Wilmington NC to Fredericksburg VA. This is our 6th move with East Coast. Obviously a good recommendation in itself. They arrived promptly, packed our glass and granite tabletops and loaded us out of the NC house on 19th. We requested a delivery date of 22nd to our new residence in Fredericksburg and they arrived and moved us in. As always the staff were friendly and very accommodating and we can't say enough good things about them!â

		<br />âAs we moved from NJ to SC we had to do all preliminary work by phone.  Carrie was very helpful and cheerfully answered my many phone calls.  Our move was complicated.  We had furniture and boxes in our home as well as a full storage unit with things we had already packed.  Most items were packed when the movers arrived but they had to wrap all furniture and odd shapes.  They did everything quickly and professionally and it was very hot that week in Jersey.  Our storage place closed at 7PM and everything was packed and gone by 6:45PM. 
			<br />When we approximated the price of our move Carrie thought the price would be $6600, but it actually came in at $5500.  I believe interstate moves are based on final weight so this was the reason for the significant difference in price.  We have bought a lot of new furniture so we did not move all of our NJ furniture.
			<br />The movers drove up from NC the day before our move and arrived at exactly at 9AM as Carrie had told me.  When they finished our house and storage unit they said they were starting the drive back south.  They drove the next day and then loaded all of our belongings into 2 storage units in NC until we need it moved to our new house at the end of September.  We left NJ several days later and the movers brought all of our property down and packed it into 2 units that we had not seen in Calabash, SC. I had marked multiple boxes and tubs with distinctive tape and asked the men to try to keep them at the front of the units so I could access them.  When we went to the units everything I asked them to keep in front was easily accessible. 
			<br />BTW.  The woman at Calabash Storage was also great and called us during the move in day to tell us we needed another unit and took care of everything for us.  We did need 2 units for all of the things but the movers packed them TIGHTLY.  No wasted space.
			<br />We will be using this company again to move us from the storage unit to our new house and I have no qualms about the type of service we will receive. OverallâEXCELLENT company to do business with! Highly recommend!â

		<br />âIt was not a rushed experience, they came in and asked exactly what I wanted moved and after that it was smooth sailing. The professional moving men were easy to talk to and even laugh with. They understood my stress and helped any way to ease it, they even took a piece of furniture up to a neighbor that we could not lift on our own. The company receptionist was very nice too and checked a second time before they came to move me to make sure all was in order on her end. Totally GREAT team!!!!âThere are no do's and don'ts to tell because it was a great experience, and I should know because I have moved six times in 3 years. East Coast Moving is A+ in my eyes!

		<br>âCarrie,
		I meant to write to you sooner, but I've been distracted with all the unpacking and with setting up the new house.  Can't believe we've been here a week already.
		Chris and the crew did a fantastic job with the move.  I unpacked our last box yesterday and not a thing was broken or misplaced.  Considering he had to pack it all up, store it, and then repack it, travel down to Florida and unpack it, I expected that something would be broken or misplaced, but all was just as we left it.   They were so careful with our things and very organized.  Moving is stressful, but both you and the crew inspired confidence the whole way through.  It was a great relief to know that everything was taken care of so professionally.
		On a personal note, everything is in order in our new home and we love living in Florida, BUT we miss all our NC friends very much.
		You can share this note on any of the sites, and if anyone would like to call me about our experience with your company, I'd be glad to talk to them anytime.  Feel free to give them my phone number.
		Thank you again for making it a smooth transition."

		<br>âI want to do a direct move from one house to another and I got a quote from East Coast Movers. They are local and my husband wants to support local business. -- They price their services based on an estimate of the wait. They do have a good local storage facility by them if we need to keep a few things there. The storage place gives the moving company a good rate. Our prejudice is to go with the local stores. They have a list of about 25 people who will recommend them if we choose the use them. We got the moving company from our Realtor at Coldwell Banker.â

Chris and his employees arrived at our home in Northern Virginia on February 14th to load our possessions & furnishings. We did most of our own packing. They packed heavy glass such as china hutch shelves, coffee table tops etc. We have a lot of glass! They also dismantled beds and a few pieces of furniture. They were very careful & efficient. On the 16th they delivered us to our home in Leland NC. Again they were prompt, careful and efficient. They put together everything they took apart and more. Right down to cleaning the china cabinet shelves after assembly. Very impressive job, crew & company. That is why we have returned 5 times for them to drive us about the country!â

		"My husband was also one of those folks that figured it was cheaper to do it himself until I showed him the real costs.  Sure, the truck can cost $20 a day...but the gas at 6 miles per gallon is an important cost.  I found that for long distance moves (I have done a couple) that these combined costs equalled the cost of a mover.  We haven't even begun to calculate the time and physical energy required to load the truck properly, drive it and unload.  I never heard another word about doing it ourselves.  (I have done this a couple of times in various years and the results are the same.)"
