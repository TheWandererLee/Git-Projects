You came to this page because right now you have some sort of problem concerning giving me money. If that's not the case, then <a href="index.php">click here</a> to go back to the main page so you can help fund my first car, or scroll down to see other things you can do to help me out.

<table border="0" cellspacing="24">
<tr><td style="font-size: 24px;">Problem<td style="font-size: 24px;">Solution
<tr><td>I have 0 dollars to my name<td>I'm not fallin for that one, try getting 10 people at school/work to give you 50 cents, now hopefully you should have 5 dollars, unless you're really bad at asking for money or you have bad breath.
<tr><td>Why should I give you 5 dollars?<td>Because obviously if you have it, you haven't used it yet, and seriously, how much more sleep are you gonna lose if you don't give me 5 dollars than if you do.
<tr><td>Why don't you just work for the money?<td>If you ask this question then you're really not looking at the whole picture. I don't have a car of course, I have to go to school still too, so I couldn't possibly come up with enough money. However when the internet comes into play there is a rule of quantity over time, 600 million people all giving me 5 dollars is more than I could make in 1,500 lifetimes!!
<tr><td>If I give you money I know I'll regret it.<td>Trust me, you will be happy for days thinking of how you gave a kid 5 dollars or more, and I doubt your wallet will suffer much from the change.
<tr><td>I don't know how to use PayPal<td>Here's the basic walkthrough: Click an amount in the bottom-right corner of any page, type in your payment information (paypal account or credit card info) and follow the easy steps to donating money to my first car. Paypal is maintained by Ebay and is very secure, your credit card information will not be seen by me or anyone else.

<p />Now I know for a fact that if you have internet then you are bound to have 5 dollars, but if you are trying to come up with excuse after excuse not to give me anything at all, fine, be like that. Next time you turn your head I just might reach through this page and grab that 5 dollars, you never know. If you are completely and entirely sure that you are going to be that much of a freeloader and not help someone else make their dream a reality, then here are some of the least things you can do to help me out:
<br /><ul>
<li>Have a website/myspace? Add a link to my website by copying and pasting this HTML code onto your website or myspace page -->
<input name="text" type="text" width="500" value='<a href="http://www.fundmyfirstcar.com/">Please help fund this kids first car!</a>' style="color: #000000;" size="50">

<li>Tell your friends about this website, and tell them to tell their friends, and tell them... you get the point. Soon enough, I'll be on the news.
<li>If you ever get on TV or call in on a radio station, give a shoutout to www.fundmyfirstcar.com! 
<li>Put up a poster in a public place of www.fundmyfirstcar.com
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/afrorock">Add me as a friend on myspace</a> - This doesn't help me at all, but I'm determined to get more friends than Tom!
</ul>
