How come I have an track of ilT and Daugystick in my manager? Also, all my other uploaded tracks aren't there anymore and when I press purge, they don't come back... =/<br /><br />Also I want to ask how you upload just one track and not everything =]
tssguy123

your awesome twl.<br />
TheWandererLee
1180485103
MrZNF, for now you cant upload just one track, you'll have to delete all the others (make sure you have backups). To get all your tracks back click the Add Your Tracks to Manager button.
MrZNF
1180489345
Ok, that's cool then. <br />But what about the two vids that aren't mine yet in my manager? I didn't put them there, can I just erase them with that minus thingie?

Hey platnium

MrZnf, yeah man use the minus button to get it out of your manager, the X button to delete the track completely only works if its yours.
MrZNF
1180633977
Ok, that's cool then. I didn't think it was wise just to press buttons without knowing what'll happen when the track isn't mine =P<br /><br />Thanks for the help =]<br /><br />And helloz Platinum ^^

If someone wants to take a track from and sceneryze it, be my guest. State in the Credits of your movie that the &quot;naked&quot; track is from me. Then It'll be fine ;)<br /><br />Bluminator is uploaded ^^

Flagpole
1185178031
twl, you said something about php limit. you'll have to talk to ezo about that as i don't have server access at .org. either that or you could do what ilt said. either way you'll need to contact ezo or ben.
TheWandererLee

I've already asked ezo to up the memory_limit and he didnt reply, but I'll try asking him again. I'll add the link to linerider.org now.
ilT LineRider
1185229747
Yea, he's hard to talk to... he's only allowed online for 1-2 hours a day, and goes on for 5 mintues at random times during the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention he runs 2 websites.
TheWandererLee
1185230235
No wonder its hard to get in touch with him...<br />I'm thinking about how mad inXile entertainment would get if I modified Line Rider to make it a line rider flash track viewer that loads tracks off the internet... I sent them an email but they're as hard to talk to as Ezo.

Make it look better, fit in with the forum. Also, I'll see if I can work something out with fsk and inXile to get a special edition of LR that plays the track in the preview window.
Conundrumer
1188522821
Sometimes, the preview for tracks are previews for other tracks. And the thumbnails may also be another track.
TheWandererLee
1188882956
mhenr18 I have tried making a custom Line Rider that would load tracks from Line Rider Share and simply run them. inXile would not reply when asked if I could make this version. I went ahead and tried anyway but the actionscript is far too advanced for me.
mhenr18
1189439021
I know how to. I can modify the screensaver to do it, but inXile will probably say no. Anyways, I've been chatting with fsk, there's a chance of there being a code-based save system now.<br /><br />*I modified the beta 2, so it loads up your beta 1 sols as well, and the physics are fine. I'm not giving it away but! XD
